Firehose on Sui Blockchain

## Pre-requisites
You would need to download the `sui-sf-indexer` source code and build it locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ticketland-io/sui-sf-indexer
cd sui-sf-indexer
cargo build --release
```
Make sure the `target/release/sui-sf-indexer` binary is moved to a folder that is in the PATH so it can be executed.

> Binaries will be available to download soon so you don't have to build from source code.
